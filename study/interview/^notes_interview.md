>Interview Assessment:
2 live-coded problems - 25min a problem - 50 ish mins total. No Docs.


### Recommendations:
* Practice using Coderpad 2-3 examples (used for interview).
* Practice taking time to prework the problem in pseudo.
* Practice 4-5 examples coding without shortcut methods.
* Run through LS examples 2-3x trying different approaches each time.
* Spend some more time using pry/IRB debugging.
* Setup some live coding sessions with students (few hours a week, medium/kyu5 or lower examples).


#### Key notes/obs for exams:
* Be **careful** using methods that you do not completely understand in timed interview questions.
* Always take time to **READ** the problem, **TEST** cases and **CLARIFY** with the Interviewer (if unsure).
