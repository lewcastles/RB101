## RB101 - Written Evaluation

>Written Assessment:
3 hours - Open book but do not blindly rely on docs, timed agressively.

### Written evaluation checklist:

* [ ] Watch prep videos w/ notes.
* [ ] Read Srdjan guide w/ notes.
* [X] Read Dalibor guide w/ notes.
* [X] Read William guide w/ notes.
* [ ] Local variable scope, especially how local variables interact with method invocations with blocks and method definitions.
* [ ] How passing an object into a method definition can or cannot permanently change the object.
* [ ] Working with collections (Array, Hash, String), and popular collection methods (each, map, select, etc). Review the two lessons on these topics thoroughly.
* [ ] Variables as pointers.
* [ ] Puts vs return.
* [ ] False vs nil and the idea of "truthiness".
* [ ] Method definition and method invocation.
* [ ] Implicit return value of method invocations and blocks.
* [ ] Variable references and mutability of Ruby objects.
* [ ] Mutating and non-mutating methods in Ruby.
* [ ] Object passing in Ruby - pass by reference or pass by value.
* [ ] Mock Test


### Recommendations
* Write notes in markdown, exams are written in this format.
* Use Flash cards for key terminology: Invoke, Call, * Parameters, Arguments.
* While working through the assessment questions it is useful to run your code often to check it, so make sure to have either ruby document/terminal or an online repl prepared beforehand.
>Recommended exam plan:
>1. Orientation (quick run through all the questions — 2-5 minutes)
>2. Reading carefully (!) assignments and answering them in order **7-9mins/question**
>3. Review (with remaining time.)

### Best practice for answering exam style questions:

Marked on non-technical ability to present information, pay attention to readability, use the features in MD to help.

Questions are testing: 
* ability to parse/describe code with precision / testing knowledge of syntactical language-specific feature of Ruby.
* understanding of connected deeper, fundamental underlying principle.
* ability to present information in a clear/concise manner.

Because of this ensure the following:
* Do not answer line-by-line unless question specfically asks for it.
* Read through the entire exam to see an approximation of what is expected then plan accordingly.
* **READ THE QUESTION, THEN READ IT AGAIN. They are designed to lead you to the answer.**
* Identify key fundamental concept(s) being demonstrated in the question.
* Explain your reasoning with reference to specific lines in the program with line numbers
* Answer with extreme precision. eg., say "method definition" or "method invocation" as opposed to just "method". _**Precise definitions, return, mutation, output & side effects**_
* Highlight specific syntactical convention / technical observations where relevant to the question i.e the fact do..end signifies a block is important if we talk about scoping rules inside said block.
* Keep text readable, use MD features to help. Block of text is a no-no.
* If referencing code. Use irb. Check results and return values. Test cases.
