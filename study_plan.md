* Run through LS examples 2-3x trying different approaches each time
* Use Flash cards for key terminology: Invoke, Call, * Parameters, Arguments
* Spend some more time using pry/IRB debuging.
* Setup some live coding sessions with students (few hours a week, medium/kyu5 or lower examples)
* Spend some time using Coderpad to code (used for interview)
* Focus on spending time to plan in pseudo.

#### Key notes/obs for exams:
* Be **careful** using methods that you do not completely understand in timed interview questions.
* Always take time to **READ** the problem, **TEST** cases and **CLARIFY** with the Interviewer (if unsure).
